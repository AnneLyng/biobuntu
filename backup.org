* Backup all or some files

** Philosophy

It is important that you backup your work. It may not be necessary to
backup all files in your home directory as this would include
auto-generated ubuntu system related files. A good approach is to save
work in folders and then add some selected files which are naturally
living in your home directory and do need backup (e.g., ~/.bashrc).

The backup philosophy here is /better save than sorry/. Hence, we use
the platform independent graphical interface =unison= to synchronize
our files. This allows us to check the *direction* of the proposed
changes before they are applied. For example, if the clock of the
server is not set correctly we could otherwise risk to overwrite our
precious work with an older version.

** Install unison (on ubuntu) 

It may be possible to install unison using system facilities but since
unison works best (read: works only if) when it has been build with
the same ocaml version on both machines we recommend the following: 

1. Download the newest version here: https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison/releases
2. Unpack the tar ball via shell command (terminal): 

=tar xfz unison-v2.51.4_rc1+ocaml-4.05.0+x86_64.linux.tar.gz=

3. [@3] Copy the files unison and unison-gtk2 to a place where your computer finds them

This typically is a folder called =bin= in home directory, i.e.,
=~/bin=. Then, check if your personal =bin= folder is in the path.  To
do so, look at the result of =echo $PATH= in a terminal. If your
personal =bin= folder is not in the path add the following lines
to the file =~/.bashrc=: 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
 if [ -d ~/bin ]; then
   PATH=~/bin:"${PATH}"
 fi
#+END_SRC
A final check is to evaluate the shell commands =which
unison= and =which unison-gtk2=. They should show the freshly unpacked unison
binaries.

4. [@4] Copy the exact same files also to a =bin= folder in your
   respective home folder on =doob=. You can do this with secure copy,
   i.e., =scp=. The machine called =doob= is a virtual linux server
   which runs redhat (not ubuntu). Make sure that also here the shell commands
   =which unison= and =which unison-gtk2= show the freshly unpacked
   unison binaries also on doob. This can be done via the command (in your home directory):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
scp -r bin bio737@doob.unicph.domain:/home/bio737/bin
#+END_SRC

# #+BEGIN_SRC sh
# sudo apt-get install --assume-yes liblablgtk-extras-ocaml-dev
# sudo apt-get install --assume-yes unison unison-gtk unison-all unison-all-gtk
# #+END_SRC

** Setup a unison profile

The profiles are saved in the folder =~/.unison/= with extension
=.prf=.  The profiles are server specific but you can have an almost
identical copy for the servers, e.g., the two files
=~/.unison/doob.prf= and =~/.unison/gauss.prf= differ only by one
line. See the example below and the manual for syntax of this file:

http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/download/releases/stable/unison-manual.html

Example: contents of file =~/.unison/doob.prf=. Change =ubuntu-user= with your ubuntu user name and =bio737= with your
KU-id:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# Roots of the synchronization
root = /home/ubuntu-user/
root = ssh://bio737@doob//home/ifsv/bio737/

# files
path=.Rprofile
path=.bashrc
path=.unison/doob.prf
path=.gitconfig
path=.emacs

# folders
path=Desktop
path=research
path=bin

# don't synchronise everything (regexp)
ignore = Name *.exe
ignore = Name *.o 
ignore = Name *~
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Run unison

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
unison-gtk -addversionno doob.prf
#+END_SRC

Then check if all directions are plausible, resolve =?= (if any), and press =GO=.
